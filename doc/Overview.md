 ERC721MintRole module is a standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds. This contract extends the ERC721Enumerable and AccessControl contracts from OpenZeppelin to create a custom ERC721 token with minting functionality.


## Features

The contract allows users with the MINTER_ROLE to mint new tokens and set token URIs.

The contract also supports querying token URIs and provides a base URI for token metadata.

## Use case

ERC721MintRole tokens are perfect for physical assets such as land, real estate, art trading, loan financing and other financial products, agricultural land management, identification, data storing and so on.
